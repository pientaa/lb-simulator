## Generator

Generator takes following parameters:
- `num_of_shards`, which defines number of vectors that will be generated - it's identical to number of shards located in total on cloud.
- `num_of_samples`, which defines nomber of periods that will be considered when generating tasks.
- `period`, which defines the amount of time related to one element of load vector.
- `shape`, which defines &alpha; parameter of gamma distribution from which number of tasks per period will be drawn.
- `size`, which defines &beta; parameter of gamma distribution from which number of tasks per period will be drawn.
 
#### Run

Generate requests and load vectors using following function from `generator` module:
```python
def generator(num_of_shards, num_of_samples, new_period, shape, scale)
```
#### Tasks distribution

Tasks are drawn from gamma distribution, but to be precise - as far as `shape` parameter is scalar -  it's Erlang distribution, whose mean and standard deviation can be calulated with following equations:

 &mu; = &alpha; * &beta; </br>
 &sigma; =  &beta; * âˆš&alpha;
 
### Example of generated data

```python
generator(5 10 5 2 2)
```
