## Generator

Generator takes following parameters:
- `num_of_shards`, which defines number of vectors that will be generated - it's identical to number of shards located in total on cloud.
- `num_of_samples`, which defines nomber of periods that will be considered when generating tasks.
- `new_period`, which defines the amount of time related to one element of load vector. Default value is `5.0`
- `shape`, which defines &alpha; parameter of gamma distribution from which number of tasks per period will be drawn.
- `size`, which defines &beta; parameter of gamma distribution from which number of tasks per period will be drawn.
 
#### Run

Generate requests and load vectors using following function from `generator` module:
```python
def generator(num_of_shards, num_of_samples, new_period, shape, scale)
```

#### Tasks distribution

Tasks are drawn from gamma distribution, but to be precise - as far as `shape` parameter is scalar -  it's Erlang distribution, whose mean and standard deviation can be calulated with following equations:

 &mu; = &alpha; * &beta; </br>
 &sigma; =  &beta; * âˆš&alpha;


## Shard allocator

Shard allocator is able to allocate shards on nodes according to one of three algorithms:
- `random` - evenly distribute shards on nodes with random order
- `sequential` - evenly distribute shards on nodes with sequential order
- `SALP` - Shards Allocation based on Load Prediction

```python
def shard_allocator(shards, nodes, algorithm_name):
```

- `shards` - number of shards
- `nodes` - number of nodes
- `algorithm_name` - one of listed above algorithm `random`/`sequential`/`SALP`


## Simulator

```python
def simulator(parallel_requests, new_period):
```

Simulator takes two parameters:
- `parallel_requests` - number of requests that could be processed on node at once,
- `new_period`, which defines the amount of time related to one element of load vector. Default value is `5.0`.

## Example of generated data


```python
generator(5, 10, 5, 2, 2)
```
